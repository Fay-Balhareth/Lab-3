Task2:

Translate an Image Write a Python script that loads an image and translates it 100 pixels to the right and 50 pixels down. Then, display the original and translated images side by side.

Rotate an Image Without Cropping Rotate an image by 30 degrees clockwise, ensuring that the entire image is visible and not cropped. Adjust the size of the resulting image window so that the whole rotated image fits within it.

Scale an Image Load an image and resize it, doubling its width while keeping the height the same. Display the original and resized images to compare them.
